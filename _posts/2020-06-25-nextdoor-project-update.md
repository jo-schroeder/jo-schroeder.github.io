*Note: This is an update to a project I worked on in February 2019 for my Digital Journalism class portfolio. <a href="http://digitaljournalism.blogs.wm.edu/2020/02/03/analyzing-no-school-moves-campaign-arlington/"> The original article can be found here.</a> This post will focus on updating the graphics for that piece. The original article contains  more context for the "No School Moves" movement, school redistricting, and integration, and I would encourage anyone interested in those topics to check it out!*

Time for a viz facelift!

Today I am revisiting a set of graphics I created a few months ago. I had a lot of fun with this project, but I do remember feeling rushed to churn out an analysis by my deadline. So, I was super excited to revisit this project and see what I could do with it now!

## The Background and Data

Before we get into the graphics themselves, let's go over the project background and data source. The assignment for this blog entry was to write about user-generated content. I am a regular follower of the local news in my hometown of Arlington, Virginia and I had been reading about controversial a plan to redistrict elementary school boundaries when I got this assignment. I thought this was an excellent topic because I was truly interested to see what insights could be gained by looking at the rhetoric of commenters. Going further, I wanted to situate this movement in a national conversation about NIMBYism and integration of schools.  

The data, then, for this project, came from comments on a January 28 Arlington Now article, <a href="https://www.arlnow.com/2020/01/28/petition-against-school-swap-garners-1700-signatures/">"Petition Against School Swap Garners 1,700+ Signatures."</a>Â and a January 19th Nextdoor post on the No School Moves petition. After checking through the data use agreements of both these sights, I determined that they were appropriate to webscrape. For privacy purposes, however, the data are deidentifed and the analysis will focus on looking a trends in aggregate.

I had two overall goals, then, for this project. My first goal was to analyze, overall, how commenters were talking about this issue. My second goal was to suss out any differences between conversations on the two platforms. On Arlington Now, commenters can hide behind anonymous usernames (Arlington Now comment threads are also known to be particularly ruthless). On Nextdoor, user's names and addresses are available to neighbors.
