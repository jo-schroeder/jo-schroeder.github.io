Do you remember when that (false?) factoid about Newton having made his greatest discoveries during the bubonic plague was circulating at the beginning of quarantine?

Well, this was my bubonic plague moment.

It all started when I was chatting with one of my friends about those funny predictive text Bots that write TV show scripts. As we were talking I had a brain blast: It would probably be relatively easy to create a Bot that writes Rupi Kaur poems. As it turns out, this idea was so good that <a href = "http://albertxu.xyz/about" it had been done before />. Yet, still the thought lingered with us. And then the real idea hit me: The Bachelor.

Among my friends, there are three seasons: The Bachelor, The Bachelorette, and Is the Bachelor back yet? Let me stress, we count ourselves among the Bachelor fans who watch the show as a *social activity*. Let me also stress, anyone who tells you they watch the Bachelor as a social activity is definitely hiding something.

In any case, the plan was set in motion. We didn't have interest in recreating Bachelor scripts as much as we did the aura of the contestants themselves. In fact, we didn't want to just create Bot contestants. We wanted to *become* Bot contestants. The final product of this project would be a quarantine-born episode of the Bachelor.

So I went to work. My first approach was based off of the text projects I was inspired by. I knew these projects started with a corpus. For my corpus, I knew exactly where to start. ABC posts bios of Bachelor contestants online.

My first step was to scrape the bios and description of each contestant.
