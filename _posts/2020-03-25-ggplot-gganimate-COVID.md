DISCLAIMER: I am not an epidemiologist. This visualization was created with the intent of being a tutorial for newbie coders using publicly available data. For accurate, up to date visualizations of COVID-19 I suggest visiting the CDC or Johns Hopkins. If you visualize COVID-19 data yourself I suggest you keep it private or share it with a disclaimer clearly stating your intentions.
