I created this website to host some of the work I'm most proud of. I hope to keep updating it with new projects and photos as I continue my journey of scratching my lifelong curiosity itch, which has thus far led me to becoming a youth empowerment leader, public health peer educator, world traveler, budding data scientist, and aspiring master of vegan cuisine among other things! In the meantime, enjoy what I've created and accomplished with me.
